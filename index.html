There is a good chance that the dip in 2008 is caused by the financial crisis (which could make sense, since an event like the financial crisis tends to affect less fortunate people than wealthier people, and wealthier people could generally be more happy than others). But of course, we need further investigation before drawing conclusions like this. Correlation does not always indicate causation. </p><p>I used “line” as the vega-lite mark, since I wanted to show the trend of happiness score over the years.</p></div></div></div></div>
